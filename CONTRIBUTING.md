# Contributing to this Quantum Algorithms Curriculum Project

All contributions to this Quantum Intuition for Quantum Algorithms Curriculum Project are welcome.  Please fork this repo and submit your code changes via a pull request.

## Submission Guidelines

### Talk to Us First

Unsolicited pull requests will be cheerfully considered, but for many reasons it's usually better to let us know in advance what you intend to do.  In some cases, we may already be working on the materials that you're considering, and one party or the other might have new information that the other was not aware of.  Also, there may be some directions or approaches that we don't want to consider for general reasons (as opposed to the specific merits of your ideas), so a quick conversation might save us both some time.

Don't hesitate to contact Tom Marshall at <tmarshall2@bloomberg.net> or Kyle Mandli at <kyle.mandli@columbia.edu> with any questions.

### Suitability Requirements

We expect that all submissions will be in reasonably clear standard English, and we reserve the right not to consider PRs that are difficult to understand for any reason.  See the above *Talk to Us First* section.

We also expect that all submissions will be of a suitably high academic standard.  We reserve the right to set that standard.

#### Scope and Relevance to the Core Mission

As discussed in the Outline documentation, this Course is intentionally very broad.  Although the breadth itself is a goal, we do need to excercise a degree of balance, and, as mentioned above, we may choose to exclude materials based on scope and relevance, even if they are of very high quality and objective merit.

Having said that, we are open to discussions on expanding the charter of this nominally single Course to cover additional topics.  However, such major organizational changes are not inexpensive even to consider.

#### Links

Please make sure that all links work correctly.  In particular, if there is a primary reference that's behind a paywall (such as Nature or Physical Review Letters) please provide a working alternative (e.g., an arxiv link).

#### Code Style

We have not yet estabilished a specific coding style or standards for this project, but we do intend to have a uniform style across this repository, and also to observe a high standard of software engineering and physical design

##### Testing

We expect that all submtted code examples will run correctly on Linux and Mac hardware with no complications.  Pseudocode examples are welcome, but should be clearly marked as such.


##### Languages

We expect that most coding examples will be in Python 3, although there may be some reason to use C++ when performance is at a premium.  Submissions in any other language will face a
very high bar of value-added before they can be accepted.  Having said that,
tools in other languages will be considered to the best of our ability to do
so. 

### Commit Hygiene

* Please make small, coherent commits whenever possible.
* Please separate independent commits onto different pull requests so that they
  can be considered and merged independently and as fast as possible.
